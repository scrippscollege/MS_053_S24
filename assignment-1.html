    <h2>Lost and Found</h2>

    <h3>Objective</h3>
    <p>
      Draw a memory of an object described to you in plain language through
      code.
    </p>

    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      We remember the past through words and images. Oftentimes when we describe
      our memories to our friends, our spoken words construct an image in their
      mind. This image is an interpretation of our memories and inevitably will
      look very different from the image in our mind. This is because unlike a
      computer programming language, the human language is spectacularly
      ambiguous. It is always approximate and never fully accurate.
    </p>
    <p>For example, to describe a smiley face:</p>

    <details>
      <summary>Human Language</summary>
      <p>The person is looking straight ahead and carrying a smile.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Computer Language</summary>
      <code>
        noFill();<br />
        strokeWeight(4);<br />
        stroke(0);<br />
        ellipse(200, 200, 100, 100);<br />
        arc(200, 215, 33, 30, 0, PI);<br />
        fill(0);<br />
        ellipse(180, 190, 10, 10);<br />
        ellipse(220, 190, 10, 10);<br
      /></code>
    </details>

    <p>
      Assignment 1 explores this ambiguity in human language as well as the gap
      between human language and computer language. Completed in pairs of two,
      you will work with a partner and exchange a detailed description (a
      memory) of a personal object you have lost in the past. Then based on the
      description, you will create an image of the object for your partner in
      p5.js.
    </p>
    <p>
      The depiction of the object does not need to be an exact representation.
      (In fact, this will likely be impossible.) The end result will be a
      combination of how the memory of the object is described to you, your
      interpretation of what that object looks like, and how you are able to
      render the object through code.
    </p>
    <p>
      The assessment of the assignment is not dependent on the work your partner
      completes. Your work will be evaluated based on the code you produce and
      reflections you write.

    <h3>Design Constraint</h3>

    <p>Canvas Size: 400 x 400px</p>

    <h3>Timeline</h3>
    <h4>Part 1 : Due 1/24</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Choose an object you have lost in the past that has meaning to you.
      </li>
      <li>
        Describe your memory of the object using plain language. It is up to you
        how much detail you impart, but be mindful of your own assumptions about
        what your partner might know about the object.
      </li>
      <li>
        Share your description (without any reference images) with your assigned
        partner over Canvas.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Part 2: Due 1/29</h4>

    <ol>
      <li>
        After receiving your partner's description, render their object on a piece of
        paper following the principles of visual composition. Once you're satisfied with your design, transfer the drawing into code. Be sure to include the following technical components in your sketch:
        <ul>
          <li>2D primitives</li>
          <li>fill() and stroke()</li>
          <li>Any combination of translate(), rotate(), push(), pop()</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Submission Guidelines</h3>
    <p>Please submit your written description and p5.js sketch on Canvas.</p>
