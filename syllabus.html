    <h3>Course Description</h3>
    <p>
      Intro to Computational Media explores code as an expressive medium for art and media makers. The course provides a critical approach to thinking and working with computation by framing programming concepts within a social and historical context. Through an anti-oppressive and feminist lens, the course unpacks design biases embedded in pervasive technology while pointing towards community-centric ways of working with computational media. Both object-oriented and procedural programming will be explored, as well as, using input and output of files, generative techniques, and image creation through data processing.
    </p>
    <h3>Learning Outcomes</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Apply critical thinking in writing and oral presentation skills
      </li>
      <li>
        Analyze the social and cultural importance of computational media art
      </li>
      <li>
        Use technical proficiency to create computational media art
      </li>
      <li>
        Create a two-dimensional computational-based project
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Community Agreement</h3>
    <p><i>The statement remixes the p5.js Community Statement, licensed under CC BY-SA 4.0 and the voidLab statement. We will discuss and make final suggestions to this statement on the first day of class.</i></p>
    <p>Intro to Computational Media is a community of learners interested in exploring the creation of art and design with technology.</p>
    <p>We are a community of, and in solidarity with, people from every gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, language, neuro-type, size, ability, class, religion, culture, subculture, political opinion, age, skill level, occupation, and background. This means that we will use preferred pronouns, respect self-identifications, and be mindful of special needs.</p>
    <p>We like these hashtags: #noCodeSnobs (because we value community over efficiency), #newKidLove (because we all started somewhere), #unassumeCore (because we don't assume knowledge), and #BlackLivesMatter (because of course).</p>
    <p>In practice:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>We are not code snobs.</li>
      <li>We listen to each other.</li>
      <li>We recognize that people learn in different ways, therefore we don’t judge when someone asks a question.</li>
      <li>We actively recognize and validate multiple types of backgrounds and perspectives.</li>
      <li>We work together and help each other out when it’s within our capacity.</li>
      <li>We keep our community respectful and open.</li>
      <li>We are mindful and kind in our interactions.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>A collaborative effort between students and the faculty is needed to create a supportive learning environment. While everyone should feel free to experiment creatively and conceptually, if a class member points out that something you have said or shared with the group is offensive, avoid being defensive; instead approach the discussion as a valuable opportunity for us to grow and learn from one another. Alternatively if you feel that something said in discussion or included in a piece of work is harmful, you are encouraged to speak with the faculty of this course or Scripps Media Studies Program Chair Carin Wing.</p>

    <h3>Course and Institutional Policies</h3>
    <h4>Attendance Policy</h4>
    <p>You may miss up to four classes and still pass this class. Note that 60 percent of the students' grade is given for work on in-class activities, and that these cannot be repeated except in extraordinary circumstances.</p>
    <h4>Participation Policy</h4>
    <p>You are expected to be attentive, ask questions, work alone and with a partner to complete your work.</p>
    <h4>Late Assignment and Missed Exam Policy</h4>
    <p>Labs and in-class activities will not be repeated except in extraordinary circumstances.</p> 
    <h4>Academic Integrity</h4>
    <p>Students are expected to abide by the Scripps College academic integrity code. You must submit work that is your own and which is original work for this class. Also, all sources must be documented. Omission of sources is considered plagiarism, even if it is an oversight and/or unintentional. All plagiarism will be reported to the department and Dean’s office for further action. For this course, collaboration is allowed in on lab activities and assignments IFF all contributions are documented.</p>
    <p>Permissible cooperation should never involve one student having possession of a copy of all or part of work done by someone else, in any form (e.g. email, Word doc, Box file, Google sheet, or a hard copy). Also, assignments that have been previously submitted in another course may not be submitted for this course, and I discourage you from finding solutions on Stack Overflow or other online forums to paste into your notebooks.</p>
    <h4>Accommodations for Students with Disabilities</h4>
    <p>Scripps students seeking to register to receive academic accommodations must contact Academic Resources and Services Staff (ARS) at <a href="mailto:ars@scrippscollege.edu">ars@scrippscollege.edu</a> to formalize accommodations. Students will be required to submit documentation and meet with a staff member before being approved for accommodations. Once ARS has authorized academic accommodations, a formal notification will be sent out.</p>
    <p>A student’s home campus is responsible for establishing and providing accommodations. If you are not a Scripps student, you must contact your home institution to establish accommodations. Below is a list of coordinators on the other campuses:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>CMC - Julia Easley, julia.easley@claremontmckenna.edu</li>
      <li>Harvey Mudd – Deborah Kahn, dkahn@hmc.edu</li>
      <li>Pitzer- Gabriella Tempestoso, gabriella_tempestoso@pitzer.edu</li>
      <li>Pomona - Jan Collins-Eaglin, Jan.Collins-Eaglin@pomona.edu</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Inclusivity Statement</h4>
    <p>This class is an example of Scripps College’s commitment to changing the norms in Computer Science. Creating this initiative at a liberal arts women's college is both a bold step towards correcting gender imbalance in this field.</p>
    <p>Our community represents a wide variety of backgrounds and perspectives. We are committed to providing an atmosphere for learning that respects diversity.</p>
    <h4>Institutional Policies</h4>
    <p>Students are responsible for reviewing Scripps College’s policies on incomplete grades, sexual misconduct, adverse weather, as well as student evaluation of instruction, and days of special concern/religious holiday.</p>
